            Hello, my name is Paul Elling.
            <p>This website is dedicated to the work I have done in my career, education, projects, and research efforts.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I have been interested in robotics since I was a kid.
                For over 25 years, I have worked as a software developer.  In my spare time, I research leadership.
                In high school and college, I took essay-writing seriously, which has helped me analyze code in my career as a developer.</p>
            <br />
            <p>For any questions, please contact me at <a href="mailto:paulelling@yahoo.com">paulelling@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
